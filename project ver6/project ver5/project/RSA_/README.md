# RSA Implementation in Python
This program implements the RSA algorithm for cryptography. It randomly selects two prime numbers from a txt file of prime numbers and 
uses them to produce the public and private keys. Using the keys, it can either encrypt or decrypt messages using the RSA algorithm.

Note: The files storing the public and private keys are formatted such that the first line is n and the second line is e or d.
